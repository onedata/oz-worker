# This is a configuration file for the pull-gui.sh script, for more see:
#   _build/default/lib/gui/pull-gui.sh

# deps directory (see pull-gui.sh -> TARGET_PATH). The package must be moved to
# the target location during release generation (usually done in rebar.config).
# The script attempts to download specified docker image from two repositories:
# docker.onedata.org (primary) or dockerhub (fallback).
